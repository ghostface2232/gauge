## Project: Gauge

Gauge is a Windows system-tray app that monitors Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor usage. Clicking the tray icon opens a small popover at the bottom-right screen corner, styled like the Windows 11 Quick Settings panel. It shows each tool's usage windows together per tool (Claude Code and Codex expose a 5-hour session window and a weekly window; Cursor exposes a single billing-cycle window). Claude Code and Codex are registered by default; Cursor can be added from settings. Gemini and Antigravity are intentionally excluded.

## Tech stack

- .NET 10 (LTS), target net10.0-windows
- WinUI 3 via Windows App SDK 2.1.x stable
- Deployment: unpackaged win32, self-contained. No MSIX.
- MVVM: CommunityToolkit.Mvvm
- Data: each tool's official OAuth usage API, called over HTTPS with the token the tool's own CLI stores locally (read-only)
- Single instance only; second launch exits silently
- Distribution: minimal per-user Inno Setup 6 installer wrapping the self-contained x64 payload

## Packaging

- `build-installer.ps1` is the release command. It publishes the self-contained x64 payload to `dist/app/win-x64`, then compiles `installer/Gauge.iss` into `dist/GaugeSetup-win-x64.exe`.
- The installer is per-user (`PrivilegesRequired=lowest`) and installs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Gauge`, so it must not require UAC.
- Keep the wizard minimal: modern style, no welcome, directory, program-group, or ready page. Retain only progress and the finished page with the optional launch checkbox.
- Do not add desktop shortcuts or an install-time start-on-boot choice. Gauge owns that preference through its tray menu. The uninstaller must delete Gauge's HKCU Run value if present.
- `Gauge.csproj` is the source of the installer version. Keep its `<Version>` updated for releases.
- The installer's `[Run]` section has two entries: the interactive finished-page launch checkbox (`postinstall skipifsilent`) and a `Check: WizardSilent` relaunch for silent updates. The in-app updater runs Setup with `/SILENT`, which has no finished page, so the WizardSilent entry is what restarts Gauge after an update.

## Releases and in-app updates

- Releases live on GitHub Releases, tagged `v<Version>` (matching `Gauge.csproj`), with `GaugeSetup-win-x64.exe` as the asset. Pushing a `v*` tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds the installer and creates a **draft** release (asset + auto-generated notes); writing the final notes and publishing the release are done manually. `release.ps1 -Draft` is the local equivalent. The in-app updater only sees a release once it is published.
- `UpdateService` checks `releases/latest` against the running assembly version, downloads the installer asset, and launches it with `/SILENT`; the app then exits (`UpdateViewModel.ExitRequested` → `App.ShutdownAndExit`) so the installer can replace files and relaunch.
- Update checks are automatic-on-launch (quiet) plus on-demand from the settings footer's single action button (localized "Check for updates" → "Update" once a newer release is found; see Localization). Applying an update is always a deliberate click — never auto-installed.
- The asset name `GaugeSetup-win-x64.exe` is contract: it is hard-coded in `UpdateService` and produced by `installer/Gauge.iss` (`OutputBaseFilename`). Keep them in sync.

## Core architecture rule

Separate data collection from UI. This is the most important constraint in the project.

- Every data source implements IUsageProvider with GetSnapshotAsync(CancellationToken).
- All providers normalize their results into one shared UsageSnapshot model.
- The UI and ViewModel depend only on UsageSnapshot, never on a provider's implementation or on a data-source's specifics.
- Rationale: the data source has already been swapped once (ccusage → OAuth usage APIs) with zero UI changes. Any future swap must touch provider implementations only, not the model or the UI.

## UsageSnapshot model

- One snapshot represents one tool at one point in time.
- Fields: tool name, optional plan label (e.g. "Max 5x", "Plus"), and a list of usage windows.
- Each window has: type (e.g. fiveHour, weekly), used ratio (0-1), reset time, display label.
- Windows are a list because tools differ. A tool may expose a 5-hour window, a weekly window, both, or neither. The UI renders only the windows a tool actually has. Do not hardcode the assumption that every tool has exactly a 5-hour and a weekly window.

Providers read each tool's **real** rate-limit usage from its official OAuth usage API — the same figures the tool's own `/usage` shows — over one shared HttpClient. The OAuth token is read from the file the tool's CLI already maintains; it is read-only (never written back) so we never race the CLI's own token rotation.

- ClaudeProvider: `GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` with headers `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20`. Token, plan, and reset tier come from `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\.credentials.json` (`claudeAiOauth.accessToken`, `subscriptionType`, `rateLimitTier`). Response `five_hour`/`seven_day` → `{utilization 0-100, resets_at ISO8601}`.
- CodexProvider: `GET https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and `ChatGPT-Account-Id`. Token from `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\auth.json` (`tokens.access_token`, `tokens.account_id`). Response `plan_type` plus `rate_limit.primary_window` (5-hour) / `secondary_window` (weekly) → `{used_percent, reset_at epochSeconds}`. This is the same endpoint the Codex CLI itself polls every 60s, so the normal 60s cadence needs no throttling (unlike Claude). Fetch failures propagate (not swallowed into an empty success) so the coordinator keeps the last good snapshot; only a missing token is a clean "no data" state.
- CursorProvider: `GET https://cursor.com/api/usage-summary`. Cursor has no OAuth bearer token; instead it authenticates with its web-session cookie, assembled as `Cookie: WorkosCursorSessionToken=<userId>%3A%3A<token>` (the literal separator is `::`, URL-encoded). The token is the JWT Cursor stores in its VS Code-style global state DB at `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\globalStorage\state.vscdb` (table `ItemTable`, key `cursorAuth/accessToken`), opened **read-only** (shared cache) so a running Cursor is never disturbed. The user id comes from the JWT's `sub` claim (last `|`-segment, e.g. `auth0|user_x` → `user_x`) and `exp` gives expiry; an expired token is a clean re-login state. Cursor bills by credit consumption over a billing cycle rather than rolling 5h/weekly windows, so it produces a single `UsageWindowType.BillingCycle` window: percent precedence mirrors Cursor's dashboard (`individualUsage.plan.totalPercentUsed` → avg(auto, api) → either lane → plan used/limit → overall personal cap → pooled team), with `billingCycleEnd` as the reset and `membershipType` mapped to the plan label. 401/403 surfaces as an authentication-required state; other fetch failures propagate so the last good snapshot is kept; a missing token is a clean "no data" state.
- Plan label: Claude maps credential fields `subscriptionType`+`rateLimitTier` (e.g. `max` + `…max_5x`/`…max_20x` → "Max 5x"/"Max 20x"), so it is available independently of a usage response. Codex maps response `plan_type` (plus/pro/…) and retains it through the coordinator's last-good snapshot on later failures.
- Never assume the JSON schema from memory. Inspect a live response from the real endpoint first, then write parsing against that actual structure.
- Why not ccusage: ccusage only counts tokens from local logs — it has no access to actual quotas or reset schedules. Its activity-based blocks, calendar-Monday weeks, and historical-max normalization do not match the real rate-limit windows, so the percentages and resets were wrong. It was removed.
- Gauge never refreshes or rewrites credentials itself. After a reboot the Claude access token is often already expired (it lives only a few hours), so rather than wait for Claude Code to be launched, ClaudeProvider triggers a **delegated refresh**: it runs the CLI's own non-interactive `claude auth status` in the background so the *CLI* refreshes and rewrites its token, then re-reads it (see Authentication ownership). Rotation stays owned by the CLI, so this can never break its login. Other providers keep showing the last good snapshot until their CLI rotates the token on use.

### Authentication ownership

- Initial OAuth login is delegated to each official CLI from the Gauge settings window: `claude /login` and `codex login` run as visible processes.
- CLI-owned credentials remain read-only **to Gauge**. Gauge never itself writes, refreshes, deletes, or logs these credentials or CLI login output, and never calls an OAuth token endpoint.
- Refresh is *delegated*, not performed: to recover an expired token Gauge may invoke the CLI's own non-interactive command (`claude auth status`, run hidden by `ClaudeTokenRefresher` via `RunHiddenAsync`) so the CLI refreshes and rewrites its own credential file. Gauge then re-reads it. The CLI keeps sole ownership of the refresh-token rotation; Gauge only nudges and reads. The nudge is cooldown-gated so it never spawns the CLI on every poll, and its output (which carries account info) is drained and never logged.
- Credential lookup is behind `ICredentialSource`; the fixed future priority is `GaugeManaged` then `CliLocal`. Only `CliLocal` is implemented in this version.
- Any future Gauge-owned PKCE flow must use an app-owned secure store and take explicit ownership of token refresh. It must not write to or refresh CLI-owned credential files.

### Claude endpoint rate limiting (important)

`/api/oauth/usage` is throttled hard: ~3 reads in a short window, then 429 with a penalty cooldown and NO Retry-After header, on a bucket shared per account/IP — so over-polling here also starves the real CLI. Naively calling it every 60s would keep the Claude card stuck at "no data". ClaudeProvider therefore:
- sends the `claude-code` User-Agent (bucketed less aggressively than arbitrary agents — the one place we deliberately match a known client's UA, for interop, not deception);
- hits the network at most once per ~5 minutes and serves its cached snapshot in between, so neither the 60s cycle nor a popover-open forced refresh makes a call each time;
- backs off exponentially on 429 (we pick the schedule since there's no Retry-After);
- returns the cached snapshot as a success while throttled/cooling down, so a 429 keeps the last good value on screen instead of clearing the card. A genuine failure (cold start with nothing cached) is the only case that propagates.
- A failed/throttled fetch must propagate as a thrown failure ONLY when there is no cached snapshot — otherwise the coordinator would overwrite the cache with an empty success.

## Tray icon

- Current implementation: H.NotifyIcon.WinUI 2.4.1. It builds successfully with Windows App SDK 2.1.x and is the selected path.
- If a future SDK update breaks H.NotifyIcon.WinUI, remove it and implement the tray icon with Win32 Shell_NotifyIcon via CsWin32, using a hidden message window to receive click events. This fallback has no SDK-version dependency; record the change here if it is taken.
- The icon is redrawable at runtime and swaps among themed variants by the highest usage level (normal / ≥70% / ≥90%), for both light and dark taskbars.
- Left-click toggles the popover. Right-click opens a context menu: a notifications toggle, a start-on-boot toggle, and exit. Both toggles show their on-state as a right-aligned ✓ (via `KeyboardAcceleratorTextOverride`), not a left check column.
- The two menu toggles are mirrors of the same global settings exposed in the settings panel, so each must stay in sync with the other surface — App applies the change and reflects it back on the opposite surface (see Settings panel). The tray service only owns the menu's visual indicator and raises an event with the new desired state; it never writes the setting itself.

## Popover window

This is a separate borderless AppWindow, not a WinUI Flyout.

- Presenter: OverlappedPresenter with no title bar or border; not resizable, maximizable, or minimizable; always on top; hidden from Alt-Tab and the taskbar (IsShownInSwitchers false).
- Backdrop: Window.SystemBackdrop set to DesktopAcrylicBackdrop for the frosted Quick Settings look.
- Borderless frame: WinUI's non-resizable OverlappedPresenter restores `WS_DLGFRAME` even after `WS_CAPTION` is cleared. Subclass the HWND with `SetWindowSubclass` and return the full window as client area from `WM_NCCALCSIZE`; otherwise a square non-client seam remains inside the rounded DWM clip. Keep the subclass delegate alive for the window lifetime and remove it when the window closes.
- Rounded corners: set the DWM window corner preference to round. Suppress the separate DWM outline with `DWMWA_BORDER_COLOR = DWMWA_COLOR_NONE`; DWM still owns the rounded clip and shadow. Do not add an XAML edge-mask Border, because it introduces a second corner geometry.
- Positioning: compute from DisplayArea WorkArea (which excludes the taskbar) and place at the bottom-right corner with a small margin. Must still hold if the taskbar is moved to another edge. Account for display DPI scaling at 100/125/150%.
- Light dismiss: implement manually. Hide the window on the Activated event when the state is Deactivated. Also close on Esc.
- Keyboard focus: Esc is a tree-level `KeyboardAccelerator`. Do not make the full-window root Grid a tab stop or focus it programmatically; doing so draws a square focus visual along the client boundary in dark mode.
- Toggle guard: when the popover is focused and the tray icon is clicked again, the click first deactivates and hides the window, then the handler reopens it, causing flicker. Record the last-hidden timestamp and ignore any open request within ~200ms of a hide, treating it as a toggle-close. Tray left-click must pass through this guard.
- Slide-in: on show, translate the root element up from a small offset while fading in, ~150-200ms ease-out. Keep the duration and offset easy to tune.

## Settings panel

The settings screen is a second view hosted **inside** the same popover window (not a separate window), with an animated slide/fade transition to and from the usage view. It keeps the usage view's measured height while shown, so the two views share one window size and one bottom bar.

- Layout is three rows: a fixed header (back button + title), a scrollable body, and a full-bleed bottom bar (version + update action) identical in height/padding to the usage footer.
- Body order (all inside the scroll): the **global settings** card first, then the per-tool authentication cards, then the "+" add-service button. The scroll turns on only when content exceeds the window height (`VerticalScrollBarVisibility=Auto`).
- Bottom padding parity: the scroll's inner panel carries a 12dip bottom margin so the gap above the bottom bar at full scroll matches the usage view's (its last card's 8dip + the list's 4dip). Keep these in step if either view's spacing changes.
- Global settings card: two app-wide toggles — **notifications** and **run-on-startup** — grouped in one card directly under the title, each a label + caption with a compact `ToggleSwitch` (empty On/Off content so it stays language-neutral).
- Ownership and sync: `GlobalSettingsViewModel` only holds the toggle state and raises an intent event; `App` owns the services, applies the change, and reflects the real result back. The two settings are each surfaced in **two** places (this card and the tray menu), so every apply path updates the *other* surface: a settings toggle updates the tray ✓, a tray toggle updates this card. The view model's reflect-back setters suspend their change events so an external update never loops as a new request. On panel open, the toggles are re-synced from the real state (start-on-boot from the registry, notifications from settings.json) to catch changes made via the tray while it was closed.
- Run-on-startup is the registry Run key via `StartupService` (no settings.json entry); the apply reads back the *actual* registry state so a failed write reverts the toggle instead of lying. Notifications enabled-state persists to settings.json and gates the live notification service (see Notifications).

## Polling and refresh

- A PeriodicTimer drives a 60s refresh of all providers.
- On each cycle, call providers in parallel, each call isolated in try-catch.
- Opening the popover triggers one immediate forced refresh, debounced: skip if the last refresh was under 10s ago and show the cached value instead.
- Cache the last successful snapshot. On failure, keep it and display it with a last-updated time.
- The toggle guard and the refresh debounce must not conflict: tray left-click passes the toggle guard first; if it resolves to open, a debounced forced refresh then runs.

## Failure isolation

- A single provider's exception must never block other providers' snapshots or the UI update.
- A failed provider shows an empty state or its last successful value.
- A credential file may be missing, a token expired, or the network unreachable. Treat these as normal flows with a clear in-app message, not as crashes.

## Notifications

Gauge raises a toast when a usage window crosses a threshold or resets. The toast is a **custom acrylic window** (`NotificationWindow` + `AlwaysActiveAcrylicBackdrop`), not a Windows Shell/UWP toast — an unpackaged win32 app has no reliable AppUserModelID for the Action Center, and an in-app window gives full control over look and fade.

- Detection (`UsageNotificationEvaluator`) is purely a function of consecutive normalized snapshots — it takes a `UsageState` and `now`, returns the notifications to show, and is fully unit-tested. Keep it free of UI and timing side effects.
  - The first observation of a window establishes a baseline, so launching Gauge already above a threshold never replays an old alert.
  - Thresholds reuse the shared usage levels (caution 70%, danger 90%): the 5-hour window alerts at danger only; the weekly window alerts at caution and danger. A crossing fires once per cycle (a per-threshold mask), and is re-armed by a reset.
  - Reset detection is reset-time advance + a usage drop; a fallback covers providers that omit reset times but requires a strong high-to-low drop. A cached/re-emitted snapshot (same or older `CapturedAt`) is never treated as a transition. A polling gap that spans a reset into an already-high new cycle is marked consumed, not replayed.
  - Only `FiveHour`/`Weekly` windows are evaluated (Cursor's billing-cycle window is not). A failed refresh keeps the window's key alive but is not evaluated as a transition. Removing a tool drops its alert history.
- Presentation (`UsageNotificationService`) is the stateful/threaded half: it queues toasts and shows them one at a time. It respects Do Not Disturb / full-screen via `SHQueryUserNotificationState` — while suppressed it holds the latest alert and a suppressed count, then surfaces a single coalesced toast ("latest of N during Do Not Disturb") when the user is available again. A query failure is treated as "present anyway", never as permanent silence.
- The global notifications toggle gates `Process` (a no-op while off) and, when turned off, clears anything queued or held so flipping back on never replays a backlog. The enabled state is read at startup from `NotificationSettingsStore` (default on) and applied to the service; it persists to settings.json.
- `--notification-demo` (read from the real process command line, since unpackaged WinUI drops EXE args) runs a developer visual-QA sequence of every alert kind in light and dark.

## UI rules

- One card per tool shows all of that tool's windows (5-hour and weekly) together — there is no view switch.
- Card header: tool name with the plan label beside it in a lighter font (e.g. "Claude Code  Max 5x").
- Each window renders a row: a label, a progress bar, a percent number, and time until reset.
- If a tool has no windows at all, show a no-data state for that card without breaking.
- Progress bar color steps by usage level (ok / caution / danger). Define colors as theme resources, never hardcoded. The current named thresholds are 70% and 90%, shared with the tray-icon variants and the notification thresholds.
- Always show the percent number, not color alone, for accessibility.
- Update the tray icon to reflect the highest usage level so state is glanceable without opening the popover.
- Follow the Quick Settings panel's generous spacing and low information density. Exact spacing and typography are left for manual tuning; do not over-fix them.

## Localization

Gauge ships Korean, English, and Japanese. The UI language is fixed once at startup; there is no in-app language switch.

- Translations live **in code** (`Localization/Strings.cs`), a `key → string?[]` table, not `.resw`/`.resx`. This is deliberate: an unpackaged WinUI app's MRT/PRI resource path is fragile, the string count is small, and the language is fixed at startup, so a plain dictionary read needs no satellite-assembly build step. Add a key by adding one row with all three columns.
- The array order is the `AppLanguage` enum's integer value — `{ Korean=0, English=1, Japanese=2 }`. **Do not reorder the enum**; the integers index the table columns. A null cell falls back to English, then to the key, so a missing translation is visible rather than blank.
- `Loc` is the facade: `Loc.Initialize(language)` is called once in `App.OnLaunched` before any window or the tray menu is built. `Loc.Get`/`Loc.Format` look up the key; `Format` uses `Loc.Culture` (derived from the language), not the ambient thread culture, for deterministic output. Korean is the default before `Initialize` runs — unit tests rely on this and assert Korean output.
- XAML resolves strings via the `{loc:Localize Key=...}` markup extension, evaluated at parse time. Because the language is fixed before any XAML loads, resolving once is sufficient — there is nothing to re-localize on a switch.
- `LanguageService` resolves the language: a valid persisted code in settings.json wins; otherwise it maps the OS UI culture (`ko`/`ja` → those, everything else → English) and persists the detected choice on first run. Resolution is pure and unit-tested.
- **Invariant-culture rule (important):** `Loc.Initialize` sets `CurrentCulture`/`CurrentUICulture` process-wide to match the language. So anything parsing or formatting **machine-facing** data — provider API timestamps and numbers, JSON, version strings — must pass `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture` explicitly rather than rely on the ambient culture. A naive `double.Parse`/`DateTime.Parse` will silently break under Korean/Japanese culture.
- settings.json is a single shared file; `AppSettingsFile` does read-modify-write and preserves unknown keys via `[JsonExtensionData]`, so the language, tool registration, and notifications-enabled stores never clobber each other.

## Code style

- Nullable reference types enabled.
- async/await throughout; never block on async.
- Isolate all network calls and JSON parsing with exception handling and timeouts.
- No hardcoded colors and no magic numbers for thresholds; use theme resources and named constants.
