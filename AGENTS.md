## Project: Gauge

Gauge is a Windows system-tray app that monitors Claude Code and Codex usage. Clicking the tray icon opens a small popover at the bottom-right screen corner, styled like the Windows 11 Quick Settings panel. It shows 5-hour session usage and weekly usage together per tool. v1 scope is Claude Code and Codex only; Gemini and Antigravity are intentionally excluded.

## Tech stack

- .NET 10 (LTS), target net10.0-windows
- WinUI 3 via Windows App SDK 2.1.x stable
- Deployment: unpackaged win32, self-contained. No MSIX.
- MVVM: CommunityToolkit.Mvvm
- Data: each tool's official OAuth usage API, called over HTTPS with the token the tool's own CLI stores locally (read-only)
- Single instance only; second launch exits silently

## Core architecture rule

Separate data collection from UI. This is the most important constraint in the project.

- Every data source implements IUsageProvider with GetSnapshotAsync(CancellationToken).
- All providers normalize their results into one shared UsageSnapshot model.
- The UI and ViewModel depend only on UsageSnapshot, never on a provider's implementation or on a data-source's specifics.
- Rationale: the data source has already been swapped once (ccusage → OAuth usage APIs) with zero UI changes. Any future swap must touch provider implementations only, not the model or the UI.

## UsageSnapshot model

- One snapshot represents one tool at one point in time.
- Fields: tool name, optional plan label (e.g. "Max 5x", "Plus"), and a list of usage windows.
- Each window has: type (e.g. fiveHour, weekly), used ratio (0-1), reset time, display label.
- Windows are a list because tools differ. A tool may expose a 5-hour window, a weekly window, both, or neither. The UI renders only the windows a tool actually has. Do not hardcode the assumption that every tool has exactly a 5-hour and a weekly window.

Providers read each tool's **real** rate-limit usage from its official OAuth usage API — the same figures the tool's own `/usage` shows — over one shared HttpClient. The OAuth token is read from the file the tool's CLI already maintains; it is read-only (never written back) so we never race the CLI's own token rotation.

- ClaudeProvider: `GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` with headers `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20`. Token, plan, and reset tier come from `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\.credentials.json` (`claudeAiOauth.accessToken`, `subscriptionType`, `rateLimitTier`). Response `five_hour`/`seven_day` → `{utilization 0-100, resets_at ISO8601}`.
- CodexProvider: `GET https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and `ChatGPT-Account-Id`. Token from `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\auth.json` (`tokens.access_token`, `tokens.account_id`). Response `plan_type` plus `rate_limit.primary_window` (5-hour) / `secondary_window` (weekly) → `{used_percent, reset_at epochSeconds}`.
- Plan label: Claude maps `subscriptionType`+`rateLimitTier` (e.g. `max` + `…max_5x`/`…max_20x` → "Max 5x"/"Max 20x"); Codex maps `plan_type` (plus/pro/…). The plan is reported even when the usage call fails, since it comes from the credential/response separately.
- Use an honest `User-Agent: Gauge/1.0`; do not impersonate another client.
- Never assume the JSON schema from memory. Inspect a live response from the real endpoint first, then write parsing against that actual structure.
- Why not ccusage: ccusage only counts tokens from local logs — it has no access to actual quotas or reset schedules. Its activity-based blocks, calendar-Monday weeks, and historical-max normalization do not match the real rate-limit windows, so the percentages and resets were wrong. It was removed.
- No token refresh is implemented. On an expired token or any HTTP/network error, the provider returns an empty window list (still carrying the plan when known); the coordinator keeps showing the last good snapshot. The token stays fresh because the tool's own CLI rotates it on use.

## Tray icon

- Try H.NotifyIcon.WinUI first.
- If it conflicts with Windows App SDK 2.1.x or fails to build, remove it and implement the tray icon with Win32 Shell_NotifyIcon via CsWin32, using a hidden message window to receive click events. This path has no SDK-version dependency. Record which path was taken.
- The icon is redrawable at runtime and swaps among themed variants by the highest usage level (normal / ≥70% / ≥90%), for both light and dark taskbars.
- Left-click toggles the popover. Right-click opens a context menu: start-on-boot toggle, exit.

## Popover window

This is a separate borderless AppWindow, not a WinUI Flyout.

- Presenter: OverlappedPresenter with no title bar or border; not resizable, maximizable, or minimizable; always on top; hidden from Alt-Tab and the taskbar (IsShownInSwitchers false).
- Backdrop: Window.SystemBackdrop set to DesktopAcrylicBackdrop for the frosted Quick Settings look.
- Rounded corners: set the DWM window corner preference to round first. If a larger radius is needed, make the window background transparent and round an inner Border instead. Keep this switchable.
- Positioning: compute from DisplayArea WorkArea (which excludes the taskbar) and place at the bottom-right corner with a small margin. Must still hold if the taskbar is moved to another edge. Account for display DPI scaling at 100/125/150%.
- Light dismiss: implement manually. Hide the window on the Activated event when the state is Deactivated. Also close on Esc.
- Toggle guard: when the popover is focused and the tray icon is clicked again, the click first deactivates and hides the window, then the handler reopens it, causing flicker. Record the last-hidden timestamp and ignore any open request within ~200ms of a hide, treating it as a toggle-close. Tray left-click must pass through this guard.
- Slide-in: on show, translate the root element up from a small offset while fading in, ~150-200ms ease-out. Keep the duration and offset easy to tune.

## Polling and refresh

- A PeriodicTimer drives a 60s refresh of all providers.
- On each cycle, call providers in parallel, each call isolated in try-catch.
- Opening the popover triggers one immediate forced refresh, debounced: skip if the last refresh was under 10s ago and show the cached value instead.
- Cache the last successful snapshot. On failure, keep it and display it with a last-updated time.
- The toggle guard and the refresh debounce must not conflict: tray left-click passes the toggle guard first; if it resolves to open, a debounced forced refresh then runs.

## Failure isolation

- A single provider's exception must never block other providers' snapshots or the UI update.
- A failed provider shows an empty state or its last successful value.
- A credential file may be missing, a token expired, or the network unreachable. Treat these as normal flows with a clear in-app message, not as crashes.

## UI rules

- One card per tool shows all of that tool's windows (5-hour and weekly) together — there is no view switch.
- Card header: tool name with the plan label beside it in a lighter font (e.g. "Claude Code  Max 5x").
- Each window renders a row: a label, a progress bar, a percent number, and time until reset.
- If a tool has no windows at all, show a no-data state for that card without breaking.
- Progress bar color steps by usage level (ok / caution / danger). Define colors as theme resources, never hardcoded. Extract threshold boundaries (e.g. 75%, 90%) as named constants.
- Always show the percent number, not color alone, for accessibility.
- Update the tray icon to reflect the highest usage level so state is glanceable without opening the popover.
- Follow the Quick Settings panel's generous spacing and low information density. Exact spacing and typography are left for manual tuning; do not over-fix them.

## Code style

- Nullable reference types enabled.
- async/await throughout; never block on async.
- Isolate all network calls and JSON parsing with exception handling and timeouts.
- No hardcoded colors and no magic numbers for thresholds; use theme resources and named constants.
