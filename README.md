# AgentGauge

AgentGauge is a Windows system-tray app that lets you check the real usage limits of Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and Antigravity at a glance.

## Features

- Shows real usage for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and Antigravity (Antigravity shows a 5-hour and a weekly limit for each of its Gemini and Claude/GPT model families).
- Register the services you want in settings, and remove them from their card (default: Claude Code · Codex; add Cursor or Antigravity from settings).
- Choose how cards display usage — horizontal **bars** or circular **gauges** — from the view-mode dropdown in settings.
- Progress bars/gauges and the tray icon turn yellow above 70% and red above 90%.
- Refreshes usage every few minutes, and immediately when you open the app from the tray.
- Caps the popover height and scrolls internally when you add many tools.
- Optional run on Windows startup.
- Light and dark mode.
- UI in English, Korean, or Japanese — detected from your Windows display language on first run (English for anything else).


## Requirements

- Windows 10 version 2004 (build 19041) or later, or Windows 11.
- An x64 PC.
- The tools you want to track installed: the Claude Code CLI, the Codex CLI, the Cursor app, and/or the Antigravity app.
- Being signed in to those tools (for Cursor and Antigravity, sign in from their own app).


## Running

1. Install with `GaugeSetup-win-x64.exe` (no administrator rights required). You can launch it straight from the finish page.
2. Left-click the AgentGauge icon in the taskbar notification area.

AgentGauge has no ordinary main window. Right-click the tray icon to toggle run-on-startup or quit the app.

Unsigned local builds may trigger Windows SmartScreen's unknown-publisher warning.


## Sign-in and data

AgentGauge never issues or refreshes credentials itself. It reads the files managed by each official CLI, read-only.

| Tool | Credential location | Sign-in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\.credentials.json` | `claude /login` |
| Codex | `%CODEX_HOME%\auth.json` or `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\auth.json` | `codex login` |
| Cursor | `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\globalStorage\state.vscdb` (read-only) | Sign in from the Cursor app |
| Antigravity | None read by AgentGauge — usage comes from the app's local engine | Sign in from the Antigravity app |

Cursor has no separate CLI login: once you sign in to the Cursor app, AgentGauge reads its local session token to display usage (the file is opened read-only).

Antigravity is different again: AgentGauge reads no credential file for it at all. It reads usage from Antigravity's own local engine over a loopback (127.0.0.1) connection — either the one the running app already hosts, or, when the app is closed, an engine AgentGauge briefly launches that signs itself in from your existing on-disk Antigravity login (and is shut down again right after the reading). AgentGauge never reads, writes, or refreshes your Antigravity credentials.

When a sign-in is needed, you can start the relevant CLI login process from the settings screen in the popover. AgentGauge does not write to or delete CLI credential files, and never logs tokens or CLI login output.


## Updates

On startup AgentGauge quietly checks GitHub for the latest release and, if a newer version exists, surfaces it on the **Update** card in settings. You can also check manually with the card's **Check for updates** button.

When an update is available, clicking **Update** downloads the installer and runs it silently: the running AgentGauge exits, the new version is installed in the same location, and the app restarts automatically. No administrator rights are required.


## Current limitations

- AgentGauge relies on the tokens each CLI refreshes, so if you go a long time without using a CLI and its token expires, you may need to sign in again from that CLI.
- The app does not implement its own OAuth/PKCE or token refresh.
- It includes no official code signing.
- Release automation currently targets x64 only.


## Credits

AgentGauge was inspired by [CodexBar](https://github.com/steipete/codexbar), the macOS menu bar app for tracking AI coding tool usage. Several design ideas — including reading the official CLIs' usage endpoints read-only and delegating token refresh back to the CLI — were learned from it.

The UI is set in [Pretendard](https://github.com/orioncactus/pretendard) by Kil Hyung-jin, bundled with the app under the SIL Open Font License 1.1 (see `Assets/Fonts/OFL.txt`).
